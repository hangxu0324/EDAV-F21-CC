Topic: Prepare SQL Interview Using Its R Translation

Recently I am interviewing with some tech companies for product Data Science and Data Analyst positions. The companies are looking for people to do A/B testing, Tableau Dashboards, and querying data from database is the rudimental step. For most of the time, tech companies who have tons of data in the database, uses Hadoop framework with querying tools like Hive. Though there are small difference in the syntax between different querying tools the database is using, the basic syntax I am going to introduce is the same. 

I decided to create a cheat sheet introducing SQL syntax for students like me so that they can pass the interviews in the Fall recruitment. SQL is usually not taught in the college, but students are usually familiar with data wrangling using R. Besides, we can access the database using R directly and writing dplyr functions to query the data you need without writing SQL, though I would not recommend that. Thus, I decided to make a SQL cheat sheet with its corresponding dplyr commends so that students can understand it easier. 

I started with a practice dataset from interview a prep website. The question is very close to the real interview question. And at the end of the cheat sheet, I introduced one question that is related to the sample dataset. I hope the viewer can write a SQL to complete the task after looking through the cheat sheet.
